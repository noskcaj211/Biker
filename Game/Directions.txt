So the game opens and you will want to press start when it opens but
not until you finish reading the directions.
So you have a score in the top right. This score is calculated by
the number of flips you do in a single jump and adds to your previous
score. You can flip clockwise or counter clockwise using the right and
left keyboard buttons. You get double score if you change the direction
you flip every time you flip (right then left then right...) It is 
possible to do double flips but you need a full jump and it is very risky. 
If you land on your head (past 90 degrees on either side of the bike) you will gameover
so be careful!
To preform a jump, you hold down the down button which charges a power
meter in the top left of the screen. When you release you will get sent
into the air.
While in the air you can flip, dive, or hold.
Flips were already talked about using the right and left buttons.
Diving increases your gravity considerable and it is preformed using
the space key (useful to get out of the way of blocks)
and hold stop you from falling for .5 seconds when you press and hold
up. You can only use hold once per jump.
You can also only start charging your jump when your bike is on the ground
the blocks have different colors to signify what they are. Yellow is on the top,
red is long, green is high, and purple is a slit. dives are useful agains yellow
and holds are useful agains purple.
You will game over if you land "on your head" or if you hit a block

If you want to restart the game quicker, press space rather than pressing the button

Have Fun!
btw run the .exe file in the Biker folder to actually play
